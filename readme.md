NOTICE:
Running the server requires many, MANY preinstalled modules and drivers, among other things.
Running the client, on the other hand, is very, very simple - just enter the URL "http://mnistproject.ddns.net:500" in your web browser of choice.

Ergo, it is advised that you only use the client side, and leave the server side to an already preprepared machine.
